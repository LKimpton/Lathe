LatheMod
========

This is Kimpton's Lathe Mod





MAIN

Basic Principle - Make columns in Minecraft.
Hey this is my Mod - WIP, feel free to help out! :)

So this is a mod that takes the real life function of Lathes to make columns for all blocks. Hopefully I will intergrate Universal electricisty. And possibly functions to make the lathe spin ect.

. I'm learning as I go along:





This I need:

Someone good at modelling to make some new models for different shapes and sizes of columns (Remaking my one)

  Pref that it is in java format and not .obj although it isnt a disaster if it is.
  
  Also need someone to make the actual Lathe Models
  
Someone to double check my code

Some good at texturing although if you're modelling you'd do this your self.
